It's not legal to call -layoutSubtreeIfNeeded on a view which is already being laid out.  If you are implementing the view's -layout method, you can call -[super layout] instead.  Break on void _NSDetectedLayoutRecursion(void) to debug.  This will be logged only once.  This may break in the future.
