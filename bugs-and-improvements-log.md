## Context

Below is a list of bugs and improvements that have yet to be addressed/fixed or implemented in the Electric Slideshow app. This list is in no particular order and is not exhaustive. It is to help track known issues and potential enhancements for future releases.

## Task

Please review the current codebase and review the following list of bugs and improvements I would like to implement. In this list, I want you to disregard any list items that are checked (`[X]`), as those have already been addressed. For the remaining items, please assess the items and give your recommendations on what order you would recommend implementing them, and if there are any that you think should be prioritized over others. Then, please respond with the updated list, including any additional context or details that may be helpful for each item, and await further instructions. I will review your recommendations and then either ask you to implement the changes or provide further instructions or clarifications.

NOTE: Once I have approved your recommended order of implementation, I want you to provide me with instructions on how to implement each item, including any code snippets or changes that need to be made. I do not want you providing instructions for all unchecked items at once. You can group more than one item together if they can be implemented easily in one set of updates on my end. But please make note of that in your response (state which items are grouped together). I will then implement the changes and ask you to review them before moving on to the next set of items.

## Bugs and Improvements

- [ ] **Slideshows List/Grid Spacing Fix**: Currently, there is no spacing between the slideshow cards in the Slideshow view, including no spacing between the cards and the left and right edges of the screen/app. I would like to add some spacing between the cards to make them more visually appealing and easier to interact with.

- [ ] **Button/Clickable Elements UX**: Right now, the vast majority of buttons and clickable elements in the app do not have any visual feedback on hover. This includes the navbar buttons, slideshow cards, and almost every other interactive element. I would like to implement a consistent hover effect across all clickable cards (like slideshow cards and the cars/tiles in the app settings), suck as a border color change, shadow, or scale effect. And for all clickable elements and buttons, I would like the cursor to change to a pointer when hovering over them.

- [ ] **Performance Guardrails**: Is there a way to predict or know when the number of photos a user has selected for a slideshow will likely cause performance issues? If so, I would like to implement guardrails or warnings to users regarding potential performance issues. For example, let's just assume that when a user hits 400 selected photos, we are confident that they have hit a threshold that will likely cause performance issues. In that case, I would like to implement a warning that appears when they hit like 350 photos selected, saying they are approaching the recommended limit of 400 photos for optimal performance. And if we believe 400 photos will start to have significant effects on performance (not just of the app but heavy memory and/or CPU use or significantly increase battery usage), then 400 can be the hard limit. However, if we believe that performance might start going downhill gradually after 400 photos, once they hit 400 selected photos, we can show a warning/dialog that says they have exceeded the recommended limit of 400 photos and that performance may be affected, which they can dismiss. If there is a way to implement this without just pulling an arbitrary number out of thin air, I would really like to explore implementing this.

- [ ] **Slideshow Music Changes**: Currently, the user assigns a custom playlist to a slideshow when they create it, and the music from that playlist will play every time the slideshow is played. However, I'd like a way to maybe start a slideshow without music playing, and in the UI somewhere, have like a dropdown field that lets the user select the music they want to play, but also lets them change the playlist at any point in the slideshow, without having to stop it and go back to the slideshow view and edit the slideshow. I'm having a hard time thinking about where this would fit well in the UI. I'm actually thinking of adding a sidebar to the Now Playing view. At first, it can just have a cool presentation of the music playing and music controls, with the option to change the playlist at any time. And later on, we can add more functionality to the sidebar, like a slideshow section that has things like what photo you are viewing out of how many photos total, maybe some neat additional metadata for the current photo, and the ability to quickly add a photo to your favorites, or remove it from the slideshow without having to go back to the slideshow view. But for now, I just want to focus on the music controls and changing the playlist in the Now Playing view.

- [ ] **Favorites Slideshow**: The idea is to have a slideshow that contains photos users have added to their favorites within the app (not photos they have favorited on their iOS library). This would be its own slideshow that users can access from the main Slideshow view. It would be a dynamic slideshow that updates automatically as users add or remove photos from their favorites. The user should be able to play this slideshow just like any other slideshow, and it should have the same music controls and functionality as other slideshows.

- [X] **Sidebar Implementation**: I would like to implement a sidebar in the app that can be used for various features and functionalities. It doesn't need to be too big, but should be big enough to accomodate an updated Now Playing view with music controls and the ability to change the playlist at any time. It should also be able to accommodate a section for the Favorites Slideshow (see below), but that will be added separately from this. The sidebar does not need to be collapsible or resizable at this time, and can be fixed (no option to hide it). I'm not worried as much about the width of this, because the vast majority of photos are in portrait orientation, so the sidebar can be a bit wider than it would be if it were just for landscape photos, as it wouldn't affect the size of the photos in portrait orientation. I just don't want it being distractingly large. We might implement the ability to collapse it later on, if it does become distracting with more features added to it, but for now, I just want to implement a fixed sidebar that can be used for the Now Playing view. And this sidebar should only be visible in the Now Playing view. Nowhere else.

- [X] **Now Playing View Improvements**: I want to update the slideshow UI/UX in the Now Playing view as follows:
  - [X] When hovering over the slideshow photos, there are slideshow and music controls that appear and then disappear when there's no cursor activity for 3 seconds. I want these controls to be removed, including the 'X' button at the top left of the slideshow photo (that used to close the sheet that was playing the slideshow. But we aren't using a sheet anymore, so this button is no longer needed).
  - [X] The only interaction with the slideshow photos should be clicking on the photo to pause/play the slideshow.
  - [X] When a slideshow is paused, the music should also pause. When the slideshow is playing, the music should also play (and the music should continue playing where it left off when the slideshow was paused).
  - [X] Interactions with the music controls should have no effect on the slideshow playback. The music controls should only control the music playback, not the slideshow. So skipping tracks, pausing, and changing the volume should only affect the music playback, not the slideshow.
  - [X] When a slideshow is paused, there should be some sort of visual indication that the slideshow is paused, such as a play/pause icon overlay on the photo or a pause icon in the bottom bar or navbar. Whichever you think is best.
  - [X] Right now, the bottom bar has the elements/buttons in place for controlling the slideshow, as well as the elements/buttons in place for controlling the music playlist for the current slideshow. However, the functionality for them isn't implemented yet. They're currently just placeholders. I want them updated to be functional controls for the slideshow and music playback.
